## Abstract

Landgate is Western Australia's premier spatial data provider. The Shared Location Information Platform (SLIP) is the WA Government's spatial data portal.

Research on spatial web service testing naturally aims to test under controlled conditions, to eliminate variables of network connectivity or device speed. Controls tend to poorly reflect real world mobile device usage. This research eschews controls for the greater part, preferring to gather data on the test environment at test time.

Further, research tends to focus on response time as the main metric of service performance, an objective measure. Few papers consider whether the data returned are correct. Mobile downloads can be interrupted by lost signal, resulting in an incomplete response. Unreliable or inconsistent response data decreases a user's desire to reuse and recommend a mapping application. Were such a situation to occur repeatedly fewer application developers would employ SLIP's services in their mobile applications and fewer end users would access Western Australia's spatial information.

LandgateAPITest is a testing suite composed of a frontline mobile device for testing and a Google App Engine web application for storage, analysis and charted results presentation. The suite combines response time measurements with errors in responses to paint a picture of Landgate's servers' suitability for mobile devices.

Deploying LandgateAPITest against SLIP's GME, OGC and Esri spatial web service endpoints confirms earlier studiesâ€™ findings and demonstrates that the mobile network is the biggest factor in performance and response quality.

The end result is a set of mobile suitability metrics. The frequency distribution of response time across a number of web service request types demonstrates performance. The percentage of requests with inconsistent response data compared to a reference measures quality.

Providing these metrics to the SLIP team will aid Landgate in objectively measuring progress towards their goal of enabling access to location information. With small modifications this can be taken and used for other organisations to carry out similar tests of their mobile readiness.
