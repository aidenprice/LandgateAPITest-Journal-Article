## Introduction

Landgate is Western Australia's cadastre authority and foremost spatial data agency. It is the leading organisation in the Western Australian Land Information System (WALIS) and its open data portal; the Shared Location Information Platform (SLIP). As SLIP was built on Google Maps Engine (GME), Google Inc.'s closure of the service forced Landgate and WALIS into a period of rapid change. Esri ArcGIS for Server infrastructure has replaced GME as Landgate's production spatial servers.

In this work, a testing suite was built consisting of a mobile application for front-line testing and a web service for analysis, named LandgateAPITest. The suite was applied to Landgate's spatial server infrastructure before and after the pivot away from GME.

The use of a mobile device as a test platform and its deployment in real world conditions is a departure from much of the academic literature on spatial web service testing. LandgateAPITest eschews experimental controls as found in related works, such as mobile devices simulated on desktop computer hardware. Further, much academic writing reports results as a few descriptive statistics of web service request response time. LandgateAPITest aims to inspect response data for returns inconsistent with reference data sets.

The testing suite provides a set of measurements as its outputs, frequency distributions of response time and a percentage of responses with inconsistent data, termed mobile suitability metrics. These are aligned with a technology acceptance model related in other works such that improvement in these scores should occasion greater user acceptance of SLIP's spatial web services. Through this work, it is hoped to uncover practical and actionable recommendations which can aid Landgate in improving their service to the community.

~~This study exists in the context of real world limitations, constrained budget, mobile devices and time. The total funds available amounted to zero Australian Dollars. Only a single mobile device could be effectively deployed in the time frame. The pre-set mobile data usage allowance capped the amount of testing possible within a given month before excess usage charges began eroding the previously described funding.~~

~~It is outside the scope of the LandgateAPITest suite to perform load testing (also known as a stress testing). The primary focus is on testing from a mobile device. This restricts the number of concurrent requests which could be launched at Landgate's infrastructure to a figure small enough that it would be unlikely to cause any difficulties. Conversely, such a method would have a significant negative affect on the device's battery life and the owner's mobile data plan.~~

Hereafter in this section, the organisations and services discussed throughout the paper are clarified. The Literature Review delves into the background of spatial web service testing and related works. The Materials and Methods section outlines the general workflow for the testing suite, it then explains the inner workings of its data model and the mobile and web applications. The Results section shows the test outcomes in charts and maps generated by the web application. The Discussion section places the results in context and leads to Recommendations and a Future Work section which details possible improvements.
